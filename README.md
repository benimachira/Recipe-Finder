## Overview:
The Recipe Finder app is a mobile application that allows users to search for and discover new recipes. The app uses the Spoonacular API to retrieve data on recipes and display them in an easy-to-use format. Users can search for recipes by name, ingredient, or meal type, and can view details about each recipe, including ingredients, cooking instructions.

## Features:
1.	Search for recipes by name, ingredient, or meal type
2.	View details about each recipe, including ingredients and cooking instructions
3.	Save recipes to a favorites list for easy access later

## API Integration:
The Recipe Finder app uses the Spoonacular API to retrieve recipe data. I utilized the API's search and get recipe endpoints to retrieve recipe information and display it to users. I also made use of the API's image endpoints to display high-quality recipe images in the app.
